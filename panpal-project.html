        <h2 > Overview </h2>

      <div class="block">
        <p> <span class="bold"> It all started with a love letter. </span> </p>

        <br> 
      <p> 
        In a long distance relationship, my friend and his boyfriend used to send letters to each other with their personal cooking recipes so that they can teach each other new dishes. Though they both wanted to learn more about cooking, they even more so wanted to grow their relationship even if they were physically apart. Hearing about my friend’s experience and reading the letters, I became fascinated by the human condition to seek togetherness.   
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> COVID-19 has perhaps helped grow a new community in the United States: amateur home cooks. According to Business Insider, stay-at-home orders, social distancing practices, and quarantine protocols have encouraged, and sometimes forced, people to buy their ingredients and prepare meals from the safety of their homes. People cook as a hobby to relax during unprecedented times of a pandemic and to save money (Chen 2020). Google Trends reveals that recipes such as Dalgona coffee and banana bread have become viral sensations as they have an increased appearance in search engine results (Lock 2020). From personal experience, I have seen a swell in the number of home cooks as my Instagram and TikTok feeds are filled with friends and strangers showing off their sourdough bread and other new recipes they have been trying. Unfortunately, public health experts are worried about how an increase in home cooking and grocery shopping will potentially increase food waste (University of Michigan 2020). The increase in home cooks brings an interesting problem in how people might better learn how to cook, share their cuisine with others, and avoid food waste.  </p>
      <br> 
      
      <p> My primary target audiences are people who want to learn how to better cook but a more engaging way that provides assistance for each step in the process, people have trouble organizing the different ingredients and supplies in their kitchen, and people looking to connect with their loved ones virtually. A secondary audience is people who are passionate about the environment–wishing to prevent their personal food waste.   </p>
      <br>
      
      <p> Pan Pal is a mobile app that allows home cooks to share recipes with their loved ones. To teach people how to better cook and organize their kitchen, my app will provide clickable, interactive recipes that map out the timing step-by-step with as well as track groceries and their expiration dates. This will also address food waste.</p>

              <br>
              <br>
              These recipes are personalized based on the user's activity on the app and ingredients that are logged onto the app. Users can also see recipes they have previously viewed but are not saved in their "Cookbooks." The last portion of the "Explore Recipe" section features recipes sorted by general categories.

              <br>
              Users can see the cooking activity of their friends when they are using different recipes on the app. This activity feed also has a “Send Tip” function where users can send quick pieces of advice to their friends. In “Cooking Connects,” users can send and view messages from their friends. Messages are minimal; users can send and receive recipes that can have attached short paragraph messages. They can react to the messages by sending emotes called “stamps.”

                  <br> 
                  <br>
                  Each recipe is mapped out step-by-step with pictures for easier understanding. Additionally, there are built-in timers for the recipe–the user does not have to set a timer manually or on another app. These recipes have a hands free option where users can use their voice to go through the different steps of the recipe.

                  <br> 
                  <br>
                  Users save recipes and store them in the “Cookbooks” section. In the “Cookbooks” section, there are options to check the user’s profiles, the tips that friends send them, and go back to the current recipe of the user if they are cooking. In this section, users can create files which means they can write new step-by-step recipes or create cookbooks which are folders to store recipes. Titles of these cookbooks can be customized. Recipes do not have to be stored in cookbooks, but if a user decides to store their recipe in the cookbook later, they can drag recipe files into cookbook files. Users can send the recipe to their friend within the recipe.

                  Users can monitor their groceries and their expiration dates in the MyFridge section. They can view the expiration dates by category: produce, pantry item, and protein. The section also provides a list of groceries that are expiring within a week of visiting the app. The My Fridge section also allows users to scan their receipts to automatically input their groceries and their expiration dates. Users will get notifications when specific groceries are about to expire.

              <h2 > Reflections & Impacts </h2>
              </div>
      <div class="block">
          <p> 
              This was the first interaction design class I have taken where I have learned formal methods to UX design. As a UX designer specifically for Pan Pal, I believe that design is a constant cyclic and interactive process. Weekly focus group sessions with users both in and outside of my class were crucial to ensuring a user-centered approach to design. Although I am motivated by the emotional stories of users. design decisions are still driven by objective data. Emotions and data are not two opposing forces.  
              <br>
              <br> 
              I believe that Pan Pal has the potential to empower home cooks in a multi-faceted way. Not only can they improve a personal life skill, but they also are able to maintain important social connections with others to improve their mental health. This is especially timely considering the COVID-19 pandemic has shaken how users live, and these same users are seeking new and creative ways to socialize.  I wish to challenge the notion that cooking is a difficult skill. I hope to promote that cooking is more social than technical. Pan Pal also has environmental impacts. The grocery tracking system and customized recipes makes it easier for users to prevent food waste. I hope to provide accessible ways for users to be more environmentally conscious. 
          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <h2 > Design Flow </h2>
      </div>

      <div class="block">
            <p> Pan Pal is divided into four unique sections: Explore Recipes, Cooking Connects, Cookbooks, and MyFridge. Users must log-in with an email and password to access the app. A design flow was created to capture the different part of the app.
            </p>
            
    
            <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/pan-pal-pics/pan-pal-design-flow.png" alt="design thinking summary"></div>
            
          </div>

  

          <div class="block">
            <h2 > Unimplemented Items </h2>
          </div>

          <div class="block">
            <p> The ability to create a step-by-step recipe in the app was not included in the current prototype of the app due to time constraints, but this would be an important feature to prototype in the app in the future. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            There are also functions that were not implemented into the app, because I wanted to keep the app minimal. Based on different focus group sessions with ten users which included classmates and people in my network who are home cooks, users expressed that they would want this cooking app to be minimal to minimize a steep learning curve and focus the priority on teaching individuals how to cook. Some features that were considered were a converter to reconfigure measurements to different units. The app does not have the ability to send text messages in a chatbox aside from the short attachments in the beginning of the recipes which was intentional as users in focus groups revealed that they already have many other ways to send text messages to their friends. There was also consideration to flag grocery items and toggle a map to show users what groceries they can buy those items, but this feature was not implemented to keep the app minimal. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Given this rich set of data, I grouped, analyzed, and summarized the sketches for trends of key elements of the website–combining it with the key insight discovered by my supervisors. 
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Tools for Development </h2>
        
      
      <br>
      <p> I used Figma to design and prototype my app. Because I am familiar with this software, it was easy to create my app. The pros include the user friendly interface of Figma which makes it easy to learn. It is similar to other design softwares, but Figma has a strong design community so that it easy to search and look for instructions on how to perform particular tasks. Additionally, Figma has plug-ins that make it easier to design. For example, there are plug-ins to easily search and upload stock photos and icons. Figma also has UI kits to get inspiration and build out the app. However, it was difficult for me to animate the transitions in Figma. In the future, I would like to figure out how to have more smooth transitions. It was also difficult for me to organize the different visual components in Figma. A large amount of frames and components make it difficult to organize especially when there are complex state changes such as variants and properties.  </p>
    

    </div>


    <div class="block">
      <h2 > User Research </h2>

      <br> 
  
      <p>
          In this class project, I first conducted market research to see the needs of home cooks. Key findings concludes that:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> <span class="bold"> &emsp; Initial Key Findings</span> </p>
      <ol>
          <li> According to Business Insider, stay-at-home orders, social distancing practices, and quarantine protocols have encouraged, and sometimes forced, people to buy their ingredients and prepare meals from the safety of their homes. </li>
          <br> 
          <li> People cook as a hobby to relax during unprecedented times of a pandemic and to save money (Chen 2020).  </li>
          <br>
          <li> 
              Social distancing guidelines due to COVID-19 can worsen mental health conditions (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2020)
          </li>

          <li>
              Unfortunately, public health experts are worried about how an increase in home cooking and grocery shopping will potentially increase food waste (University of Michigan 2020).  
          </li>
        </ol>
      <br>
      
      <p> <span class="bold"> There is a need for users to learn how to better cook but also seek connection with others.  </span></p>
    </div>


    <div class="block">
      <h2 > Competitive Analysis </h2>
      <br>

      <p> I conducted a competitive analysis to see what already exists among academic institutions and non-profit organizations in increasing access to health care and social service resources for LGBTQIA+ young people. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/pan-pal-pics/pan-pal-competitive-analysis.png" alt="competitive analysis"></div>
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/pan-pal-pics/pen-pal-competitve-analysis-2.png" alt="competitive analysis"></div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> While apps such as AllRecipes Spinner, Side Chef, and Yummly have interfaces to view recipes, they lack intuitive features to connect with other home cooks in a user’s networks on a personal level. Additionally, there are apps such as Pantry Check that allow users record groceries and expiration dates through scanning barcodes, but the process of scanning individual barcodes could be long and daunting with little reward for the user. I researched different timer apps as well to gain inspiration for how a recipe could showcase time. I liked how a HIIT interval timer uses a circle to display time and is pronounced in the center of the screen while there are other timers on the side that the user can see.   
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="block">
      <h2 > Sketches </h2>
      <br>
      <p> From this research, I sketched out different solutions to how users might improve their cooking skills, reduce food waste, and make connections. No two ideas are alike. </p>
    </div>


    <div  class="image-left"><img src="img/pan-pal-pics/chai-sketch-1.png" alt="pan pal sketch 1"></div>

    <div class="image-right"><img src="img/pan-pal-pics/chai-sketch-2.png" alt="pan pal sketch 2"></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="block">
    <p> After I presented these sketches to focus groups in my class, the idea of writing letters to loved ones received the most positive reception. Users expressed that they appreciated the level of personal engagement one would have with another person. Other ideas such as calling a friend or learning through a TV cooking show were not interesting to users as it was already something one might already do to improve their cooking skills.  </p>
    </div> 


    <div class="block">
      <h2 > Storyboarding </h2>
      <br>
      <p> From sketches, I took each idea and constructed a storyboard to illustrate the details for a user’s interaction.  </p>
    </div>

    <div  class="image-left"><img src="img/pan-pal-pics/si582_sketch2_part1of2.png" alt="pan pal sketch 1"></div>

    <div class="image-right"><img src="img/pan-pal-pics/si582_sketch2_part1of2.png" alt="pan pal sketch 2"></div>
    <br>
    <br>
  <div class="block">
    <p> I sat with users for more focus group sessions. The ideas that elicited the most positive response were the ones that had elements of interaction with other people such as phone calling, video chatting, and writing letters. Users emphasized that they liked how I paid special attention to how cooking is an important social practice.  </p>
  </div>


  <div class="block">
    <h2 > Personas </h2>
      <br>
      <p> From iterating over several sketches and storyboards as well as conducting multiple focus group sessions, I created four personas to illustrate my target users, and one anti-persona to illustrate users I might not capture with my solution. Users would be people who desire to connect with others, share recipes, and learn how to cook. They also would want a way to be organized as novice home cooks.  </p>
    </div>

    <div  class="image-left"><img src="img/pan-pal-pics/pan-pal-persona-1.png" alt="pan pal sketch 1"></div>

    <div class="image-right"><img src="img/pan-pal-pics/pan-pal-persona-2.png" alt="pan pal sketch 2"></div>
    <br>


    <div class="block">
      <h2 > Story Mapping </h2>
    <br>

        <p> To solidify a user flow, I developed a story map over the multiple personas to pinpoint the specific pattern of how users might learn how to cook a recipe. Again, in learning how to cook a recipe, users would gravitate towards reaching out to others to share tips or ask for advice.  </p>
      </div>

      <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/pan-pal-pics/pan-pal-story-map.png" alt="story map"></div>
      <br>
          

      <div class="block">
        <h2>Low-Fidelity Mock-Ups and Questions, Options, Criteria Analysis </h2>
        <br>
  
        <p> From story mapping, I finalized that the solution would be an app where users can find tailored recipes, connect with other home cooks, view recipes to learn how to cook, and keep track of cookbooks and groceries. 
            <br>
            <br>
          I conducted a Questions, Options, Criteria (QOC) analysis and created several different types of low-fidelity mock-ups to think through how I might design the app. 
           <br>
           <br>
          I wanted to apply a mix of these choices. From my interactions, I realized that the features I want to use are the ones that need the least amount of clicks to view and also have good affordances and signifiers to guide the user. I also wanted to include pictures to humanize the technology of the app. I decided to keep a navigation bar as well as a step-by-step recipe structure. A navigation bar also let’s users immediately view a  recipe dashboard and other screens more immediately without clicking extra buttons. I decided to make users create accounts because I want them to create connections with others and so that their data is saved. I included the block organization messages are organized by the friends’ profiles. Having an optimal way of organizing messages is important for users to foster human connection even if in distance.

          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <h2 > Paper Prototyping </h2>
      <br>

        <p>
          From an iteration of mock-ups and QOC analysis, I create a paper prototype of my app. Users enjoyed the high level of production and fidelity of my paper prototype. One suggestion was to make sure there are back buttons so that users can easily navigate among different screens and interactions. Another suggestion was to include labels for the navigation bar icons as the symbols might lack a level of affordance for some users to indicate where it would take them.
