        <h4 class="case-study-tagline"> Why is addressing LGBTQ+ health important?</h4>
        <p> Although there is vibrance in queer spaces, there is also hurt. Youth in the LGBTQ+ community has historically faced numerous health disparities due to stigma, lack of education, and systemic oppression. </p>

        <h4 class="case-study-tagline"> But there are advocates trying to change those numbers. </h4>

        <p> The Community Health Access Initiative (CHAI) is a coalition of community organizations, youth, and academic partners offering a free training and technical assistance program to improve the health and well-being of LGBTQ+ youth in Michigan. CHAI is focused on improving mental health and substance use outcomes among LGBTQ+ youth by increasing access to inclusive and affirming health care.</p> 
    
        
        <div class="case-study-artifact big"> <figure><img src="img/case-study/chai-members.png" /> <figcaption> Pictures of the CHAI team</figcaption></figure></div>
  
        <p> CHAI previously had a website to house tailored health care resources to help achieve their mission, but the disorganization of resources and accessibility errors (lack of color contrast, alternative text, and keyboard navigation) leaves it unusable. </p>
        <p> As the designer and developer, I worked with CHAI and a team of UX researchers to redesign the CHAI website for a mobile and desktop platform. </p>
        <p> LGBTQ+ youth in Michigan are primary users, and health care providers are secondary users. </p>

            <p> I followed a 6-step design process to synthesize user research and deploy the website. Because the target audience of CHAI is LGBTQ+ youth, I made the process agile and shifted between the different phases to actively involve community members. I was in constant communication with CHAI supervisors and the action committee ‚Äì LGBTQ+ youth who create and curate CHAI resources and training ‚Äì to receive feedback through weekly meetings and email. </p>

            <h3> Method #1: Focus groups ‚Äì to co-create with the community</h3>
            <p> Researchers on the team conducted focus group sessions with 13 young LGBTQ+ people in Michigan. Participants in these focus groups answered questions about their needs for an LGBTQ+ website for health care resources and their thoughts about existing health care resources.
            </p> 
         
                <p>
                    The focus group sessions also included a design activity where participants could quickly sketch out mock-ups of an ideal LGBTQ+ health care website for young people. I analyzed and summarized the sketches and find organizational themes.

            <p> To make a robust website, I designed the mobile version before moving onto the desktop version to ensure responsiveness. After receiving feedback from CHAI and the research team, I created a hi-fidelity prototype to test with the action committee. One key performance indicator included task completion for (1) Successfully find specific health care resources and (2) find mental health provider training that is only available to providers.  </p>

            <h3 class="case-study-block-title"> Impact & Reflections </h3>
            <h4 class="case-study-tagline"> How did I create a change?</h4>
            <p> I developed the website using Webflow and F‚Äôin Sweet‚Äìa custom vanilla JavaScript framework. I handed off the designs, log-in information, and design specs to CHAI. </p> 
            
            <h3> Impact </h3>
            <ul class="unordered-list">
                <li> The redesigned website decreases the time to find specific resources</li>
                <li> I presented my work at the 2021 UMSI Student Exposition and won 1st place for the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion award out of 50+ teams. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3> Success & business metrics  </h3>
            <p> I recommended that CHAI look at the following metrics to define success</p>
            <ul class="unordered-list">
                <li> Increased clickthrough rate for resources </li>
                <li> Increased registration for CHAI training  </li>
            </ul>

            <h3> Night mode </h3>
            <p> LGBTQ+ youth can safely browse the website without worrying that light emitted from a bright screen will attract attention 
            </p> 

            <h3> If I had more time </h3>
            <p> To improve the product, I would have conducted follow-me-home and walkthrough interviews with users to narrow the scope and better define specific health-seeking behaviors that exist among LGBTQ+ youth. </p>


            <h3> Final thoughts </h3>
            <p> I am humbled to have the opportunity to work with people of the LGBTQ+ community in Southeast Michigan to improve the health and well-being of LGBTQ+ youth by increasing access to affirming and inclusive health care services. Through the continuous and intentional involvement of the community in the design process to amplify voices of minoritized populations and understand how user needs can directly align with client objectives, I learned how to better design for long-term projects even if resources are limited. </p>
