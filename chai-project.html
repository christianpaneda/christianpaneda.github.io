            The Collective Health Access Initiative (CHAI) is a coalition of community organizations, youth, and academic partners offering free trainings and technical assistance programs to improve the health and well-being of LGBTQIA+ youth in Washtenaw County, Michigan. CHAI is focused on improving mental health and substance use outcomes among LGBTQ+ youth in Washtenaw County by increasing access to inclusive and affirming health care. University partners represent various departments and are experts in psychology, social work, psychiatry, and LGBTQ+ physical and mental health. The Community Health Access Initiative (CHAI) is a project from the Resistance and Resilience Collective within the University of Michigan School of Public Health (UM-SPH).  
          </p>
          <br>
          <p> Currently, CHAI has a live website to direct providers, youth, and allies to their LGBTQIA+ health-related resources and training. However, the website has many accessibility issues related to color contrasts and coding semantics.  </p>
          <br> 
          
          <p> As the lead UX Designer & Web Developer, I was hired to redesign and develop a new website for CHAI. I worked under the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI) faculty while working with CHAI staff from UM-SPH as well as the 5-member CHAI Action Committee of young professionals who identify as LGBTQIA+ community members and served as users. This case study highlights the design of the mobile-version of the website.  </p>

                <br>
                <br>
                Users are able to learn more about CHAI faster. If the user is lost, they can return to a landing page to see other available information that is more descriptive than a hamburger menu. The different ways of accessing the same information will appease to different use cases. More information on the landing page = less interactions for users to try to learn more about CHAI.

                <br>
                <br>
                Users can find specific resources faster. They have the choice to view all resources or ones relevant to their needs.

                    <br>
                    This organizes the information architecture of the website. It makes it easier for users to understand which resources are relevant to them.

                    <li> My boss who is a professor was really impressed by my work. My designs were used as examples to teach students in the undergraduate and graduate Interaction Design classes (a required class within the Bachelor’s and Master’s Curriculum). </li>

            <p> I followed a five-phase design thinking process to assist my client with their needs. This is a long-term (1+ year) project, so I have iterated over the entire process several times to integrate feedback in the designs and include community input.

            <p> <span class="bold"> Synthesizing Focus Group Research </span></p>
            <br> 
            <p> User research actually started while I was applying and interviewing for my position. I learned about the mission of CHAI, needs of the client, and expectations as the principle UX Designer and Web Developer. I had several meetings with my supervisors and the CHAI staff before moving onto user interviews. These stand-up with my supervisors occur every week, and then every month with the CHAI staff to elicit continuous feedback. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The creation of the website aligns with overall academic research of my supervisors who are professors and doctoral candidates. My supervisors have conducted focus group sessions with 13 users who identify as young LGBTQIA+ people in the state of Michigan. Participants in these focus groups answered questions about their needs for an LGBTQIA+ website for health care resources and their thoughts about existing health care resources. The focus group sessions also included a design activity where participants could quickly sketch out mock-ups of an ideal LGBTQIA+ health care website for young people.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Given this rich set of data, I grouped, analyzed, and summarized the sketches for trends of key elements of the website–combining it with the key insight discovered by my supervisors.

            <p> <span class="bold"> &emsp; Initial Key Findings</span> </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Users need to a way to search and ask for relevant LGBTQIA+ health care resources within the website</li>
                <br> 
                <li> Users need a solution to be accessible in its design such as color contrasts, code semantics, and availability among devices </li>
                <br>
                <li> 
                    The website has multiple audiences. It should be useful to not only LGBTQIA+ youth but also providers
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Users want the want to be diverse beyond solely LGBTQIA+ identity (e.g. race, ethnicity, body type) 
                </li>
              </ol>
            <br>
            
            <p> <span class="bold"> User Interviews </span></p>
            <br>
            <p> Users interviews and testing are conducted every other month to build strong working relationships and to design the website with the community. </p>
            <br>  
            <p> So far, I have conducted a first-round of qualitative user interviews with all five of the CHAI Action Committee members to understand their needs as young LBGTQIA+ community members and explore the user experience of the website. Interviews were conducted via online video call so that they could share their screens and lasted between 45 minutes to 1 hour. </p>
            <br>    
            <p> I created an interview protocol to guide conversations about user needs and to conduct user testing with the mobile version of the website. Themes explored in the interviews include: LGBTQIA+ inclusion, LGBTQIA+ health care needs, accessibility of the prototyped website, and overall feedback on the visual components of the website. </p>
            <br>
            <p> <span class="bold"> Qualitative Data Analysis: Affinity Mapping </span></p>
            <br>
            <p> From the first-round of five user interviews and meeting notes with CHAI staff, I created an affinity map to organize trends and themes from the large data set. After each interview, I wrote affinity notes in a spreadsheet. I pasted all of these notes into sticky notes on Miro, grouped them, summarized them, and extracted high-level insights from the patterns.  </p>

            <p> <span class="bold"> &emsp; User Insights from Interviews </span> </p>
            <ol>
                <li> The purpose of the CHAI website is to empower the community by sharing LGBTQIA+ resources to youth and providers. The website should be a hub for people to learn more about the initiative.</li>
                <br> 
                <li> Information on the website should rely on spacing and images to convey information rather than words. </li>
                <br>
                <li> 
                    Website should implement more elements for discoverability
                </li>
              </ol>
            <br>

            <p> <span class="bold"> Competitive Analysis </span></p>
            <br>
            <p> I conducted a competitive analysis to see what already exists among academic institutions and non-profit organizations in increasing access to health care and social service resources for LGBTQIA+ young people.

                The landing page and the hamburger menu are two different ways to get to the same

                designed with one of the key user insights in mind.

            <br>

            The design system was created to appeal to the main audience of young LGBTQIA+ individuals. Therefore, it has a young, vibrant look. Colors were chosen based on the existing CHAI logo and edited to ensure accessibility in color contrast.

                <span class="bold"> Decision #1: Create a landing page contains mission of CHAI website, resources, and events</span> 
                <br>
                <br>
                The Action Committee expressed that they want the website to educate those unfamiliar with CHAI about the different opportunities and community efforts. The existing CHAI website only provides a brief mission statement. In the redesign, I chose to implement a landing page that not only includes a mission statement but also the different resources, events, and contact information so that there are less interactions for the user to learn more about CHAI. The user only has to view the landing page to get a better sense of CHAI’s services. A landing page centralizes all information; if the user is lost, they can return there to see other available information if they want something more descriptive than a hamburger menu. Additionally, different ways of accessing the same information will appease to different use cases.

                <span class="bold">Decision #2: Create a resource page with a filter</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                The Action Committee expressed that the website should allow users to find health care 
                resources specific to their needs faster. Therefore, I created a more organized resource page. I created a filter so that users can quickly find tagged resources they are looking for. The filter can be expanded or hidden, so users can first see all resources if they would like a high-level overview. The new filter in the resources page allows flexibility for the different use cases of the websites.

                    <span class="bold">Decision #3: Split up the provider, resources, and events page, and contact page</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Action Committee expressed that the website should appeal to different users such as LGBTQIA+ youth, parents, and providers. The old website had confusing information architecture and misleading wording. It was not apparent that “All Opportunities” meant provider-only resources. Additionally, CHAI hosts events but there is no page to reflect that, and the action committee expressed that they want a website where users are comfortable with asking questions. Therefore, I reorganized the information architecture of the website--creating different pages for providers, resources, events, and contact information. Differentiating this information will make it easier for users to access the information that is relevant to them but also make it clear what information is not accessible for them, yet they still want to know more about all of CHAI’s resources. There is also a contact page with a form where users can ask questions which gives CHAI a more personal feel.

                    <span class="bold">Decision #4: Create cards to illustrate and separate information</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Action Committee expressed that use of inclusive images and illustrations is important to communicating information and making the content more accessible by making it more understandable (e.g. less jargon). The old CHAI website uses a lot of text. In the redesign, I created different cards for resources and events. Imagery helps the user understand specific health care content, and the organization of the card makes information more understandable and digestible, especially on a mobile device. Colors in the card are accessible for users with low vision.

            I created a mock-up of the app and website on Figma. I made some adjustments to some of the layouts on the app with the approval of the client for better user experience. I illustrated the icons on the website and app using Procreate and Adobe Photoshop. </p>

          <p>
            I am humbled to have the opportunity to work with people of the LGBTQIA+ community in Southeast Michigan to improve the health and well-being of LGBTQIA+ youth by increasing access to affirming and inclusive health care services</p>
            <br>
           <p>Through the continuous and intentional involvement of the community in the design process to amplify voices of minoritized populations and understand how user needs can directly align with client or business objectives, I learned how to better design for long-term projects. </p> 
            <br>
           <p>Design should meaningfully involve users to facilitate a more nuanced integration of business objectives in face of accessibility and user experience.
