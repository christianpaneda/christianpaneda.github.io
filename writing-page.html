  <div class="block">
    <h2 > Overview </h2>
  </div>
  
    <div class="block">
      <p> 
        <span class="bold"> Note: </span> A previous article was published in the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/tito-taglish-a-language-learning-app-fc1ff415f077" target="blank" class="extra" alt="link to article"> UX Collective</a>. This version has been updated for clarity.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> In collaboration with the non-profit organization, The National Federation of Filipino American Associations — I collaborated with their youth outreach program to assist in a capstone project related to Filipino language learning. </p>
      <br> 
      
      <p> User research indicated that there is a strong desire for young Filipinx individuals who are not proficient in a Filipino language to learn Taglish, a combination of Tagalog and English commonly used in the Philippines.
      Although popular language learning apps like Duolingo exist, such platforms do not offer any Filipino language option. </p>
      <br>
      
      <p>Given a huge market gap, I designed and developed a responsive website as well as prototyped a mobile app that houses materials that encourage young FIlipinx individuals to learn Taglish. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2 > Design Process</h2>
    </div>
    
      <div class="block">
        <p> I followed a five-phase design thinking process to assist my client with their needs. </p>

        <br>

        <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/design-thinking.png" alt="branding summary"></div>

      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <h2 > User Research </h2>
      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <p> We conducted an online survey among Filipinx individuals around the world, most of which resided in the United States. There were 495 respondents. Three key insights were found from the data:</p>

        <ol>
          <li> A majority (73.4%) of the sample group are likely to watch a video series to improve Taglish skills. Of respondents who identify with novice proficiency or below, the top two most useful language learning resources were those that were created for beginner audiences and had interactive elements.</li>
          <br> 
          <li> Speaking and listening are the top two language skills that people would like to improve. </li>
          <br>
          <li> Respondents expressed that they want to learn a Filipino language to connect to their families and heritage, but are often discouraged by perceived difficulty and people making fun of them for below-average proficiency. </li>
        </ol>

      </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Personas </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p> From user research, I created two personas. </p>
        </div>

        <div  class="image-left"><img src="img/persona-1.png" alt="Tito Taglish persona 1"></div>

        <div class="image-right"><img src="img/persona-2.png" alt="Tito Taglish persona 2"></div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Vision &#38; Brand </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p> The client wanted a playful aesthetic, something similar to video games for children. The data verified that users would enjoy the same aesthetic as many enjoy video games and language learning apps for younger/beginner audiences. The client and I brainstormed a mood board to further conceptualize a vision for the products. Therefore, I came up with a brand design that is fun, simple, and almost child-like. I believe it appeals to a diverse audience of young adults. </p>
        </div>

        <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/branding-summary.png" alt="branding summary"></div>

        <div class="block">
          <p> The brand design includes a warm color scheme, typography, and logo. I used Figma and Procreate. The predominately orange color represents the optimistic tone of the products, and the playful appearance of Nunito Sans conveys a sense of encouragement for users to learn the language. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Deliverables </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p> Though brainstorming and the user research, the client and I determined the following outcomes for the project: </p>

          <ol>
            <li> Conceptualize and develop a responsive mobile website to house the client’s teaching materials such as videos and worksheets. The website should also include information about the non-profit and how to contact the client</li>
            <br> 
            <li> Prototype a companion mobile app to address user needs to improve speaking and listening skills while making the experience interactive </li>
          </ol>

        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Wireframing </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p>
            The client gave me complete freedom of all the layouts. For a minimal yet optimal flow, I wanted the website to be one page. The user can click the navigation bar to skip ahead to each of the sections.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/lo-fi-wireframe.png" alt="branding summary"></div>

        <div class="block">
          <p>
            The mobile app accounted for the fact that users wanted visual, auditory, and tactile elements in their experiences. I envisioned a main menu screen for the app to better organize the lessons and resources. There are five sections to the app: “Videos”, “Play”, “Learn”, “Tips”, and “Club.” The video section fulfills the users’ visual needs. The “Play” and “Learn” sections fulfill the users’ auditory learning needs as they check for the users’ correct pronunciation of words or phrases. The “Play” section also addresses tactile learning elements as users will play games as a means for learning. </p>
             <br> 
            <p> The “Tips” section provides positive reinforcement for users: an important concern found in the user research. The “Club” section allows users to interact and video chat with each other to practice listening and speaking skills. </p>
              <br>
            <p> Once the wireframes and brand were approved by the client, I moved on to prototyping. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Hi-Fidelity Mock-Ups </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p>
            I created a mock-up of the app and website on Figma. I made some adjustments to some of the layouts on the app with the approval of the client for better user experience. I illustrated the icons on the website and app using Procreate and Adobe Photoshop. </p>
             <br> 

             <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/website-1.png" alt="landing page"></div>

             <br> 

             <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/app-1.png" alt="mockups 1/2 "></div>

            <br>

             <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/app-2.png" alt="mockups 2/2"></div>

             <br>

            <p> The mock-ups of the app will be used for the prototype. I applied my working knowledge of Taglish to work with the client for copywriting language. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Coding the Website </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p>
            I coded the website using HTML and CSS using glitch.me as the text editor and host. I used a bootstrap framework to better organize the code. </p>
             <br> 

             <div class="block image-center"><video class="project-vid-medium" autoplay loop> ==$0 <source src="assets/website-tito-taglish.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video></div>

             <br>
             
            <p> <a href="https://tito-taglish.glitch.me/" target="blank" class="extra" alt="link to article">Here is the link to the website </a> </p>

        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Prototype </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block quote-text">  <p>
          I imported the hi-fidelity mock-ups to InVision to create the prototype. Not all of the details are featured in the prototype, such as a profile and settings page, but my goal was to present the most important elements to the client most relevant to addressing the key insights. </p> </div>
        
          <div class="block image-right"> <iframe width="442" height="935" src="//invis.io/NMYFA4S39UT" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></div>

             
          <p> <a href="https://invis.io/XVYFA4RCJPE " target="blank" class="extra" alt="link to article">Here is the link to the prototype </a> </p>

        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Reflection </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p>
            The client was very satisfied with the deliverables. The next steps are to conduct user testing and make adjustments to the app’s and the website’s language. The website is fully deployable, and the code is available to the client for any further changes. The client should hand-off the prototype to developers for the actual deployment of the mobile app.</p>
             <br> 
            <p> I was really happy with the outcomes. As I continue in my journey as a product designer, I am happy to use my skills to help non-profit organizations. I gained experience working with clients where I am given a lot of creative control. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I believe, however, there is room for improvement. This is the first project where I made a prototype of a mobile app. I definitely learned that there are different practices when designing mobile apps versus web pages. In the future, I hope to design more clean designs. I am starting graduate school soon where I will be studying UX Research and Design. I hope to learn more about the design thinking process, consulting skills, and visual design best practices to create more accessible and professional products.
