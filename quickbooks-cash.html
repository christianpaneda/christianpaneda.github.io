            <p> I worked with a cross-functional team to design the end-to-end experience for the virtual wallet features in QuickBooks Cash on iOS and Android mobile devices. QuickBooks Cash offers a business bank account as a powerful all-in-one banking and bookkeeping hub for small businesses.  </p>

            <h3 class="case-study-block-title"> My Experience </h3>
            <h4 class="case-study-tagline"> What did I do at Intuit?</h4>
            <p> I was a product design intern on the Intuit QuickBooks money team to empower prosperity for small businesses and self-employed customers. Specifically, I had the pleasure of being a part of the QuickBooks Cash design team. 
            </p> 
         
                <p>
                    In 2020, QuickBooks added a business checking account to its QuickBooks Online product suite. QuickBooks Cash offers business checking features including high interest, ACH transfers, a debit card, and access to an ATM network. QuickBooks Cash is designed to integrate seamlessly into the rest of QuickBooks.

                <p>
                    I had the responsibility of designing an upcoming table stakes feature of QuickBooks Cash  ‚Äì the virtual wallet. I worked with a team of product managers, developers, and marketing partners to conceptualize and execute the full end-to-end experience for QuickBooks mobile users on iOS and Android. I also worked with Intuit QuickBooks‚Äô banking partner, GreenDot, to insure legal compliance. The virtual wallet is set to ship in FY22 Q1 for both QuickBooks Mobile and Money by QuickBooks.

            <h3 class="case-study-block-title"> Reflections </h3>
            <h4 class="case-study-tagline"> What did I learn at Intuit?</h4>
            <h3> Key Learnings</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> üåê Product thinking with the whole ecosystem in mind
            </p> 
         
                <p>
                    Intuit QuickBooks is a massive software system is a long legacy of impact for businesses. 
                </p> 


                <p>
                  It was important for me to think about my project and how it fits with other features and the workflow for customers. With that in mind, I was able to advocate for customer needs and create necessary changes to the information architecture of QuickBooks as a whole.  
              </p> 
              <br>
              <br>

        <p> üéÅ Feedback is a gift
        </p> 
     
            <p>
                My design process was very agile, and it was critical to always share my work with fellow designers and cross-functional partners to not only get buy-in but also get valuable feedback to think about revisions or challenges to expand my thinking. 
            </p> 


            <p>
                Not only did I learn the importance of getting feedback as an act of intentional collaboration, but I also learned to critically think about feedback and take only the necessary or most resonating parts. Because of my team, I learned how to be stronger together. 
          </p> 


          <br>
          <br>

    <p> üî¨ Feedback is a gift
    </p> 
 
        <p>
            Before transitioning to design, I had an extensive back in research. Originally I thought that I would only interact with research in a limited capacity to make data-driven positions. However, I learned that I should always leverage a strong research background to truly drive a systematic way of thinking about design and to also have deep empathy for the user.
