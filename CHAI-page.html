    <h2 > Overview </h2>
  </div>
  
    <div class="block">
      <p> 
        The Collective Health Access Initiative (CHAI) is a coalition of community organizations, youth, and academic partners offering free trainings and technical assistance programs to improve the health and well-being of LGBTQIA+ youth in Washtenaw County, Michigan. CHAI is focused on improving mental health and substance use outcomes among LGBTQ+ youth in Washtenaw County by increasing access to inclusive and affirming health care. University partners represent various departments and are experts in psychology, social work, psychiatry, and LGBTQ+ physical and mental health. The Community Health Access Initiative (CHAI) is a project from the Resistance and Resilience Collective within the University of Michigan School of Public Health (UM-SPH).  
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> Currently, CHAI has a live website to direct providers, youth, and allies to their LGBTQIA+ health-related resources and training. However, the website has many accessibility issues related to color contrasts and coding semantics.  </p>
      <br> 
      
      <p> As the lead UX Designer & Web Developer, I was hired to redesign and develop a new website for CHAI. I worked under the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI) faculty while working with CHAI staff from UM-SPH as well as the 5-member CHAI Action Committee of young professionals who identify as LGBTQIA+ community members and served as users. This case study highlights the design of the mobile-version of the website.  </p>
      <br>
      
      <p><span class="bold"> How might I partner with public health experts, providers, and LGBTQIA+ coalitions to better communicate health care resources and trainings in a website by leveraging community partnerships for user-centered design? </span>

        <h2 > Design Overview </h2>
      </div>

      <div class="block quote-text">  
        <p>
            Decision #1: Create a landing page contains mission of CHAI website, resources, and events 

            Users are able to learn more about CHAI faster. 
            If the user is lost, they can return to a landing page to see other available information that is more descriptive than a hamburger menu. 
            The different ways of accessing the same information will appease to different use cases. 
            More information on the landing page = less interactions for users to try to learn more about CHAI

      <div class="block quote-text">  
          <p>
            Decision #2: Create a resource page with a filter 

            Users can find specific resources faster
            Users have the choice to view all resources or ones relevant to their needs 
          </p>

        <div class="block quote-text">  
            <p>
                Decision #3: Split up the provider, resources, and events page, and contact page

                Organizes the information architecture of the website
                Makes it easier for users to understand which resources are relevant to them

        <div class="block quote-text">  
            <p>
                Decision #4: Create cards to illustrate and separate information 

                Imagery helps the user understand specific health care content
                The organization of the card makes information more understandable, especially on a mobile device

            <h2 > Impact </h2>
            </div>
    <div class="block">
        <p> 
            <ol>
                <li> I made the website more accessible by designing within WCAG 2.01 guidelines. </li>
                <br> 
                <li> My boss who is a professor was really impressed by my work. My designs were used as examples to teach students in the undergraduate and graduate Interaction Design classes (a required class within the Bachelor’s and Master’s Curriculum). </li>
                <br>
                <li> My designs are currently being used as supporting material for a grant application from Google to support further work on LGBTQIA+ young people’s online information seeking. </li>
              </ol>
      

        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2 > Design Process</h2>
    </div>
    
      <div class="block">
        <p> I followed a five-phase design thinking process to assist my client with their needs. This is a long-term (1+ year) project, so I have iterated over the entire process several times to integrate feedback in the designs and include community input. 
        </p>

      <div class="block">
          <p> <span class="bold"> Focus Group Research Analysis </span></p>
        <p> User research actually started while I was applying and interviewing for my position. I learned about the mission of CHAI, needs of the client, and expectations as the principle UX Designer and Web Developer. I had several meetings with my supervisors and the CHAI staff before moving onto user interviews. These stand-up with my supervisors occur every week, and then every month with the CHAI staff to elicit continuous feedback. </p>

        <p>
        Given this rich set of data, I grouped, analyzed, and summarized the sketches for trends of key elements of the website–combining it with the key insight discovered by my supervisors.

        <br>
        <p>
            <span class="bold"> Initial Key Findings</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li> Users need to a way to search and ask for relevant LGBTQIA+ health care resources within the website </li>
                <br> 
                <li> Users need a solution to be accessible in its design such as color contrasts, code semantics, and availability among devices </li>
                <br>
                <li> The website has multiple audiences. It should be useful to not only LGBTQIA+ youth but also providers </li>
                <br> 
                <li>
                    Users want the want to be diverse beyond solely LGBTQIA+ identity (e.g. race, ethnicity, body type)  
                </li>
              </ol>
        </p>

          <p> <span class="bold"> User Research </span></p>
        <p> 
            Users interviews and testing are conducted every other month to build strong working relationships and to design the website with the community. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> 
            So far, I have conducted a first-round of qualitative user interviews with all five of the CHAI Action Committee members to understand their needs as young LBGTQIA+ community members and explore the user experience of the website. Interviews were conducted via online video call so that they could share their screens and lasted between 45 minutes to 1 hour. 
        </p>
        <br> 
        <p>
            I created an interview protocol to guide conversations about user needs and to conduct user testing with the mobile version of the website. Themes explored in the interviews include: LGBTQIA+ inclusion, LGBTQIA+ health care needs, accessibility of the prototyped website, and overall feedback on the visual components of the website.

          <h2 > Vision &#38; Brand </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p> The client wanted a playful aesthetic, something similar to video games for children. The data verified that users would enjoy the same aesthetic as many enjoy video games and language learning apps for younger/beginner audiences. The client and I brainstormed a mood board to further conceptualize a vision for the products. Therefore, I came up with a brand design that is fun, simple, and almost child-like. I believe it appeals to a diverse audience of young adults. </p>
        </div>

        <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/branding-summary.png" alt="branding summary"></div>

        <div class="block">
          <p> The brand design includes a warm color scheme, typography, and logo. I used Figma and Procreate. The predominately orange color represents the optimistic tone of the products, and the playful appearance of Nunito Sans conveys a sense of encouragement for users to learn the language. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Deliverables </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p> Though brainstorming and the user research, the client and I determined the following outcomes for the project: </p>

          <ol>
            <li> Conceptualize and develop a responsive mobile website to house the client’s teaching materials such as videos and worksheets. The website should also include information about the non-profit and how to contact the client</li>
            <br> 
            <li> Prototype a companion mobile app to address user needs to improve speaking and listening skills while making the experience interactive </li>
          </ol>

        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Wireframing </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p>
            The client gave me complete freedom of all the layouts. For a minimal yet optimal flow, I wanted the website to be one page. The user can click the navigation bar to skip ahead to each of the sections.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/lo-fi-wireframe.png" alt="branding summary"></div>

        <div class="block">
          <p>
            The mobile app accounted for the fact that users wanted visual, auditory, and tactile elements in their experiences. I envisioned a main menu screen for the app to better organize the lessons and resources. There are five sections to the app: “Videos”, “Play”, “Learn”, “Tips”, and “Club.” The video section fulfills the users’ visual needs. The “Play” and “Learn” sections fulfill the users’ auditory learning needs as they check for the users’ correct pronunciation of words or phrases. The “Play” section also addresses tactile learning elements as users will play games as a means for learning. </p>
             <br> 
            <p> The “Tips” section provides positive reinforcement for users: an important concern found in the user research. The “Club” section allows users to interact and video chat with each other to practice listening and speaking skills. </p>
              <br>
            <p> Once the wireframes and brand were approved by the client, I moved on to prototyping. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Hi-Fidelity Mock-Ups </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p>
            I created a mock-up of the app and website on Figma. I made some adjustments to some of the layouts on the app with the approval of the client for better user experience. I illustrated the icons on the website and app using Procreate and Adobe Photoshop. </p>
             <br> 

             <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/website-1.png" alt="landing page"></div>

             <br> 

             <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/app-1.png" alt="mockups 1/2 "></div>

            <br>

             <div  class="image-center"><img src="img/app-2.png" alt="mockups 2/2"></div>

             <br>

            <p> The mock-ups of the app will be used for the prototype. I applied my working knowledge of Taglish to work with the client for copywriting language. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2 > Coding the Website </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p>
            I coded the website using HTML and CSS using glitch.me as the text editor and host. I used a bootstrap framework to better organize the code. </p>
             <br> 

             <div class="block image-center"><video class="project-vid-medium" autoplay loop> ==$0 <source src="assets/website-tito-taglish.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video></div>

        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p>
            I imported the hi-fidelity mock-ups to InVision to create the prototype. Not all of the details are featured in the prototype, such as a profile and settings page, but my goal was to present the most important elements to the client most relevant to addressing the key insights. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <p> <span class="bold"> Impacts </span> 
            <ul class="about">
              <li > As my first UX client-based UX project, my initial write-up about my process was selected by the UX Collective, an online publication with 390,000+ followers on Medium. My article allowed me to become a UX writer for them! </li>
              <br> 
              <br>
              <li> The client and I were able to engage an initial user pool of 500+ Filipinx individuals from over 10 countries. </li>
              <br> 
              <br>
              <li> The client was highly satisfied and is currently working to adopt the code, prototype, and designs for the future of Tito Taglish.  </li>
            </ul>
          
          </p>

          <br>

          <p> <span class="bold"> Reflections </span> 
            <br>
            The client was very satisfied with the deliverables. The next steps are to conduct user testing and make adjustments to the app’s and the website’s language. The website is fully deployable, and the code is available to the client for any further changes. The client should hand-off the prototype to developers for the actual deployment of the mobile app.</p>
             <br> 
            <p> I was really happy with the outcomes. As I continue in my journey as a product designer, I am happy to use my skills to help non-profit organizations. I gained experience working with clients where I am given a lot of creative control. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I believe, however, there is room for improvement. This is the first project where I made a prototype of a mobile app. I definitely learned that there are different practices when designing mobile apps versus web pages. In the future, I hope to design more clean designs. I am starting graduate school soon where I will be studying UX Research and Design. I hope to learn more about the design thinking process, consulting skills, and visual design best practices to create more accessible and professional products.
